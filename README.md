Mutliple linear regression modelling and testing using r

This multiple regression model is used to predict solubility levels of compounds based on different predictors such as oxygen, hydrogen levels…etc. Various techniques such as ordinary least squares, partial least squares and penalized models have been used to improve the model parameters.
All code have been referred from the book “Applied predictive Modelling” by Max Kuhn.This is one of the best books on predictive analytics using regression and classification techniques.
